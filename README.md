Parse Solidity Code into Spider Monkey API compliant AST

This is a (much more) refined version of [solidity-parser](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-parser). 
I've fixed a lot of [bugs](https://github.com/duaraghav8/sultan/issues/1) and added features as per solidity grammar spec (but obviously its not perfect a.t.m.). I plan to maintain it long-term =)
